# Ant Algorithm Pathfinding in Open Space

This project is a C# implementation of an ant algorithm pathfinding system in Unity. 
The algorithm is used to find the path in an open space, rather than in a graph as is typically the case.
The ants follow one of two types of pheromones - "Food" or "Home" - to navigate through the space.

## Installation
To use this project, you will need to have Unity installed. Clone the repository and open the project in Unity. 
You can then build the project or run it in the Unity editor.

## Usage
The ant algorithm pathfinding system can be used to visualize of algorithm. 
The ants will follow the pheromones to navigate through the space and find the path to their destination. 
You can adjust the parameters of the algorithm to see how it affects the ants' behavior.

## Credits
This project was created by Me. 

Implementation made by me, based on [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A)

The algorithm is based on the ant colony optimization algorithm developed by Marco Dorigo in 1992.
